- Suppose bug exists in 63rd commit
- Creating a shell script to find 63 string text
> cat > test.sh << END
> if grep 63 projectfile
> then
>   echo BAD
> else
>   echo GOOD
> fi
> END

- Now Create 100 commits
- for ((i=1;i<=100;i++))
> do
> echo $i >> projectfile
> git commit -am "A$i"
> done

- Now use git bisect to look for 63rd file/commit
- git bisect start
- Mark BAD state
    - git bisect bad --> Current Commit that is Broken
    - git checkout HEAD~99 --> Move to first commit on this branch
    - git bisect good --> Mark Current commit as Good, if it is good !!
    - Now keep on checking if commit pointed to by git bisect is good or bad, and mark it accordingly
